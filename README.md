# Masters-Thesis
Electric Motor Modelling with Graph Neural Networks

The aim of the Master Thesis is to train a neural network to learn the parameters of Electric Motors and thus be able to predict its KPIs(key performance indicators). 

We have developed and trained a MLP neural network on the tabular representation of data to predict 2 KPIs. 

The KPIs are 2D and 3D plots on Torque(Mgrenz) curve and Efficiency(ETA) grid.
